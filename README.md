# AmygdalaFC

This is a repository for the minimal data set for PlosOne submission.

Contributions of human amygdala nuclei to resting-state networks. Arguizones, U., Seoane, S., Janssen, J., & Janssen, N. (in revision).

There are three files that represent the core of the results in the manuscript:

1. FC_analyses.zip
- Contains the output of fslmeants for each participant individual backprojected FC_map with aparc+aseg as well as with amygdala nuclei files. Note in fslmeants linenumbers denote the label. These data were used to compute the statistics in the study.

2. srICA_dim7.zip
- Contains the output of the group melodic ICA restricted to the amygdala.

3. whole_brain_FC_maps.zip
- Contains the output of the backprojected ICA to the whole brain using Dual Regression for each participant and then combined into a group map using fsl randomise using one sample t-test.

Please contact me for further information.
